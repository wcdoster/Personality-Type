    <h3>Personality Characteristics</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>They are comfortable challenging their managers’ ideas and have 
            a strong (and well-expressed) dislike for restrictive rules and 
            guidelines. Debaters back this unorthodox behavior with their 
            keen minds and curiosity, and are as capable of adopting new 
            methods as they are of suggesting others do so. </li>
        <li>They can’t stand simple, routine work, and
            monotonous tasks are the stuff of nightmares. </li>
        <li>It is as colleagues that Debaters prove most polarizing, 
            as their passions for brainstorming, debate and over-analysis 
            drive more practical, task-oriented colleagues crazy, but serve as 
            stimulating inspiration for those who appreciate the innovation
             Debaters bring. </li>
        <li>Management is often where Debaters are most at home, allowing 
            them the freedom to fiddle with different approaches and come 
            up with innovative ways to tackle new challenges without having 
            to handle the tedious step-by-step implementation of these plans.</li>
        <li>The challenge for Debaters is focus, as they may find themselves 
            jumping from project to project in a quest for challenge and 
            excitement before their teams are able to wrap up the details
             of their existing goals and obligations.</li>
    </ul>
